 Usage: recs-fromatomfeed <args> [<uris>]
    Produce records from atom feed entries.
 
    Recs from atom feed will get entries from paginated atom feeds and create a record stream from the results. The keys of the
    record will be the fields in the atom field entry. Recs from atom feed will follow the 'next' link in a feed to retrieve
    all entries.
 
 Arguments:
    --[no]follow                 Follow atom feed next links (or not). Defaults on.
    --max=<n>                    Print at most <n> entries and then exit.
    --filename-key|fk <keyspec>  Add a key with the source filename (if no filename is applicable will put NONE)
 
   Help Options:
       --help  This help screen
 
 Examples:
    Dump an entire feed
       recs-fromatomfeed "http://my.xml.com"
    Dumps just the first page of entries
       recs-fromatomfeed --nofollow "http://my.xml.com"
