 Usage: recs-fromatomfeed <args> [<uris>]
    Produce records from atom feed entries.
 
    Recs from atom feed will get entries from paginated atom feeds and create a
    record stream from the results. The keys of the record will be the fields in
    the atom field entry. Recs from atom feed will follow the 'next' link in a
    feed to retrieve all entries.
 
 Arguments:
    --[no]follow                 Follow atom feed next links (or not).
                                 Defaults on.
    --max=<n>                    Print at most <n> entries and then exit.
    --filename-key|fk <keyspec>  Add a key with the source filename (if no
                                 filename is applicable will put NONE)
