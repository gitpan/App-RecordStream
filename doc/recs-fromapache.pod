recs-fromapache

=head1 recs-fromapache --help-all

 Usage: recs-fromapache <args>
    Each line of input (or lines of <files>) is parse by Apache::Log::Parser to
    produce an output record.
 
 Arguments:
    --fast                       'fast' parser works relatively fast. It can
                                 process only 'common', 'combined' and custom
                                 styles with compatibility with 'common', and
                                 cannot work with backslash-quoted double-quotes
                                 in fields. (This is the default)
    --strict                     'strict' parser works relatively slow. It can
                                 process any style format logs, with
                                 specification about separator, and checker for
                                 perfection. It can also process backslash-quoted
                                 double-quotes properly.
    --verbose                    Verbose output.
    --woothee                    Each agent field of records is parse by Woothee
                                 to produce woothee field.
    --filename-key|fk <keyspec>  Add a key with the source filename (if no
                                 filename is applicable will put NONE)
 
   Help Options:
       --help  This help screen
 
 Examples:
    Get records from typical apache log
       recs-fromapache < /var/log/httpd-access.log
    A more detailed how to use (See perldoc Apache::Log::Parser)
       recs-fromapache --strict '[qw(combined common vhost_common)]' < /var/log/httpd-access.log
    Get records except access of crawler
       recs-fromapache --woothee < /var/log/httpd-access.log | recs-grep '$r->{woothee}{category} ne "crawler"'
